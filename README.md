    - [x] scoped blocks
    - [x] if statements
    - [x] else statements
    - [x] add Strings
    - [] logical operators
    - [x] add while loop
    - [] rethink how i handle expr / declaration / reassignment
    - [] add for loop 
        - [] make fields in for loop optional
    - [] add floats
    - [] add functions
- [] interpreter
    - [x] print stmt
    - [x] scoped blocks
    - [x] if statements
    - [x] else statements
    - [x] strings
    - [] logical operators
    - [x] while loop
